This is the plan for a language course generator. Now I have to generate some images based on the value (true, null, false.. true stands for "an image can be generated") that you find on the right of the keys.
For each of the keys for which an image is possible, I have to create a full description of the picture so that I could use the description itself to understand if the student is truly understanding the whole context.
A detailed description of the image is a description of at least 10 sentences. I have to know all the details in the picture, leaving ideally nothing out of the immagination.
Let's start with "1.1 Learn the alphabet and individual letters" for example. Create me 2 detailed descriptions of possible images that can support the student.
