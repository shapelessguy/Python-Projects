Create an \".editorconfig\" file in the root directory of your project.\n\n2. Open PyCharm and navigate to \"File\" -> \"Settings\" (or \"Preferences\" on macOS) to open the Settings dialog.\n\n3. In the Settings dialog, expand \"Editor\" and click on \"Code Style\".\n\n4. At the bottom of the Code Style settings, you will find a link labeled \"Manage\". Click on it to open the \"EditorConfig\" settings.\n\n5. Make sure that the \"Enable EditorConfig support\" checkbox is checked.\n\n6. By default, PyCharm will automatically detect the .editorconfig file in your project's root directory. If you have placed the file in a different location, click on the \"+\" button and select the path to your .editorconfig file.\n\n7. Click on \"Apply\" and then \"OK\" to save the changes.\n\nFrom now on, PyCharm will read the rules defined in your .editorconfig file and apply them to your project's code style."}]}
