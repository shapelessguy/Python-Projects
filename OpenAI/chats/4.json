It refers to the ability of a computer system to understand and respond to human language in a way that is similar to how humans communicate with each other. NLI technologies enable users to interact with computers and software applications through spoken or written language, allowing for more intuitive and user-friendly interactions. This field of study includes areas such as natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG). NLI helps to bridge the gap between humans and machines, making it easier for people to interact with technology."}]}
