Typically, the process starts around 12 to 16 weeks of age and is usually complete by around 6 to 8 months old, but this can vary depending on the breed.\n\nHere is a general timeline of how dogs go through the teething process:\n\n1. 2 to 4 weeks: Puppies are born without teeth.\n2. 3 to 6 weeks: Baby teeth, also known as deciduous or milk teeth, start to emerge. Incisors are usually the first to come in, followed by canines and premolars.\n3. 4 to 5 weeks: Puppies begin to explore solid food and chew on objects as their baby teeth continue to develop.\n4. 3 to 5 months: During this stage, puppies' baby teeth start to loosen as the permanent teeth begin to grow. The incisors are usually the first baby teeth to fall out.\n5. 4 to 6 months: The canine teeth, premolars, and molars start replacing the corresponding baby teeth. The process can cause discomfort and increased chewing behavior.\n6. 5 to 7 months: The majority of permanent teeth should have erupted by this stage, and the teething process is generally complete. Adult dogs have 42 permanent teeth.\n\nIt is important to note that the teething process can vary from dog to dog, and timing may differ based on breed, genetics, and individual factors. During this time, providing appropriate chew toys and objects can help alleviate discomfort and redirect chewing behavior from household items.\n\nIf you have concerns about your dog's teething process, it is always a good idea to consult with a veterinarian to ensure their oral health is on track."}]}
