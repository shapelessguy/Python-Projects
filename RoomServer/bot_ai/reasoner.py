Remember it is extrimely important that if you recognize a theme, you just reply with the name of the theme [THEME_NAME], therefore the user will know if you

{intro} if there is enough information in the request to call the function {fname}.
The function {fname} has this description: {f_description[fname]}. This function also requires the following arguments:
{args_str}
If there are not enough arguments for the functions, you just prompt the user for the missing information! There is nothing worse than returning a function with
missing or incorrect arguments!
Now that you know how to use the function, the resulted formulation must be given in the following format:
[execute][{fname}]{''.join(['[' + n + '=??]' for n in f.arguments])}{', where the ?? must be replaced by the actual values in the request' if len(f.arguments) > 0 else ''}.
Remember it is extrimely important that if you recognize the arguments, you just reply with that specific format.
In order to fill the arguments you might track back in the discussion trying to find the missing argument.
For instance if the conversation goes "User: I bought a tape", "Assistant: "How much did you pay?", "User: 7 euro", then you know that the user bought tape for 7 euro.
Remember that your answer will be passed to a function, therefore either you reply with all the necessary arguments in the right format, or you prompt for more explainations.
For instance an answer like "[execute][CreateExpense]How much did you pay?" is not acceptable, but "[execute][CreateExpense][price_str=1.50][comment=plants]" or "How much did you pay?" are.
Remember, ONLY ONE MESSAGE, NOTHING MORE.
For instance:
