It is a cheap and reliable car. I use it in conjunction with a Mello Yello bus for lessons. It is a good size for a driver to practice in.\n\nWhen you first start to learn to drive, you should probably start with driving on a flat surface. Don't go on a steep hill, you don't need to be on a freeway yet. Also, don't try to go too fast, just stay in the middle of the lane and start at a very slow speed. It is better to start slow and get a feel for the car and then start to pick up speed as you get better. You can always slow down. It is important to start slow and build up speed.\n\nYou should probably take lessons for the first couple of months. The instructors will probably want to get you used to the car, and you\n"
